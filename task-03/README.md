- In Python, ```sys.argv``` is a list that stores command-line arguments passed to a script when it's executed from the terminal. This allows you to make your scripts more flexible and dynamic.

- ```Pyperclip``` is a Python library that allows you to interact with your computer's clipboard directly from your Python code, essentially enabling you to copy and paste text programmatically, making it useful for applications where you need to dynamically copy data to the clipboard for pasting elsewhere, like in GUI applications or data manipulation scripts.
